<p>
	I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist working at Amazon. 
</p>

<p>
My research focuses on machine-learning, in particular in AutoML and probabilistic time-series forecasting. In the past, I also worked on Computational Topology and Geometry Processing.
</p>

<p>
I deeply enjoy taking inspiration of real-problems to do academic research (and the other way around too!). Some of this research went into AWS services such as the forecasting service <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html">DeepAR</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning.html">AWS hyperparameter tuning service </a>
or more recently <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-recommender.html">AWS SageMaker inference recommender</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am also very keen on working on open-source, I am a core developer of <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune">Syne Tune</a> (Hyperparameter Optimization), I was also a core-developer of <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts">Gluon-ts</a> (time series forecasting), <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/datawig">Datawig</a> (data imputation) and <a href="https://gudhi.inria.fr">Gudhi</a> (computational topology).
