<p>
	I am a Machine Learning Scientist working at Amazon. 
</p>

<p>
My research focuses on machine-learning, in particular in probabilistic time-series forecasting and AutoML and hyperparameter optimization. In the past, I also worked on Computational geometry and topology and geometry processing.
</p>

<p>
I deeply enjoy taking inspiration of real-problems to do academic research (and the other way around too!). Some of this research went into AWS services such as the forecasting service <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html">DeepAR</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning.html">SageMaker hyperparameter tuning service </a>
or more recently <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-recommender.html">SageMaker inference recommender</a> which allows to automatically select efficient endpoint configurations to deploy ML models.
</p>

<p>
I am also very keen on working on open-source, I am a core developer of <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune">Syne Tune</a> (Hyperparameter Optimization), I was also a core-developer of <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts}">Gluon-ts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/datawig">Datawig</a> and <a href="https://gudhi.inria.fr">Gudhi</a>.
