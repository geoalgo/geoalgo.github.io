<p>
I am working at ELLIS institute and the university of Freiburg. Before that I worked 7 years at Amazon as a Senior Applied Scientist and 1 year at NAVER LABS Europe. 
</p>

<p>
I currently lead a research group focused on producing high-quality LLMs for all official European languages as part of two European projects: OpenEuroLLM and LLMs4EU. Our group specializes in pre-training, post-training, and evaluation of large language models. 
</p>

<p>
My research focuses on machine-learning, in particular in AutoML, LLMs, and probabilistic time-series forecasting. In the past, I also worked on Computational Topology and Geometry Processing.
</p>

<p>
I deeply enjoy taking inspiration of real-problems to do academic research (and the other way around too!). Some of this research went into AWS services such as the forecasting service <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html">DeepAR</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am also very keen on working on open-source, I am a core developer of <a href="https://github.com/syne-tune/syne-tune">Syne Tune</a> (Hyperparameter Optimization) and SlurmPilot <a href="https://github.com/geoalgo/slurmpilot">SlurmPilot</a> (python wrapper to schedule experiments on Slurm). I was also a core-developer of <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts">Gluon-ts</a> (time series forecasting), <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/datawig">Datawig</a> (data imputation) and <a href="https://gudhi.inria.fr">Gudhi</a> (computational topology).
