title: MESS summer school - 2024 Catania

I gave the following two lectures at the 3rd international Metaheuristics Summer School â€“ [MESS 2024](https://www.ants-lab.it/mess2024/):

* Multiobjective optimization ([slides](https://geoalgo.github.io/downloads/multiobjective.pdf?attredirects=0))
* Speeding-up Hyperparameter Optimization with transfer and meta learning ([slides](https://geoalgo.github.io/downloads/transfer-learning.pdf?attredirects=0))


I highly recommend the other lectures on meta-heuristics and NAS, thanks a lot to the organizer for inviting me :-)
